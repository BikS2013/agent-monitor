# Issues - Pending Items

This document tracks issues, pending items, inconsistencies, and discrepancies detected during development.

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ Infinite Loop in AI Agents View (Fixed 2025-05-24)
- **Issue**: UI hanging with infinite loop of cleanup calls when navigating to AI Agents page
- **Problem**: Multiple useEffect hooks triggering each other causing continuous re-renders
- **Root Cause**: 
  - `forceUpdate()` calls in useEffect dependencies
  - Automatic cleanup on component mount triggering repeatedly
  - Over-aggressive logging causing performance issues
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Removed automatic cleanup on component mount
  - Made `cleanupInvalidAgents` stable with `useCallback`
  - Removed `forceUpdate()` from useEffect dependencies
  - Reduced excessive console logging
  - Simplified agent selection handlers
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/views/AIAgentsView.tsx` - Removed problematic useEffect and forceUpdate calls
  - `src/context/AIAgentsDataContext.tsx` - Made cleanup function stable with useCallback
  - `src/components/AIAgentsList.tsx` - Removed automatic cleanup and reduced logging
- **Result**: UI now loads smoothly without infinite loops

### ✅ AI Agent Validation Too Strict (Fixed 2025-05-24)
- **Issue**: Agent validation was too strict, filtering out valid agents from API responses with missing optional fields
- **Problem**: Agents with missing `name`, `model`, or `status` fields were being completely rejected
- **Root Cause**: Validation logic required all fields to be present and non-empty
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Loosened validation to only require `id` field for API agents
  - Added automatic defaults for missing required fields (`name`, `model`, `status`)
  - Added migration logic for old field structure (`modelName` → `model`)
  - Enhanced logging for debugging API data issues
  - Added force update mechanism to ensure UI reflects data changes
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/AIAgentsList.tsx` - Loosened filtering logic
  - `src/context/AIAgentsDataContext.tsx` - Enhanced validation and logging
  - `src/views/AIAgentsView.tsx` - Added force update mechanism
- **Testing**: Verified with `test_scripts/test-agent-validation.js`

## Pending Issues

### ❌ Edit Agent Modal: API Returns Malformed Agent Data (In Progress)
- **Issue**: Agent update "succeeds" but returns agent with no ID, causing it to be filtered out
- **Problem**: API response transformation missing `model` field, only setting `modelName`
- **Root Cause**: `transformApiAIAgent` method not mapping model fields correctly for app format
- **Evidence**: Console shows `{id: undefined, name: '', model: undefined}` after "successful" update
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Fixed `transformApiAIAgent` to properly set `model` field from API response
  - Added comprehensive logging to track API response transformation
  - Enhanced field mapping to handle various API response formats
  - Added missing fields like `specializations`, `conversationsProcessed` etc.
- **Status**: Testing in progress
- **Priority**: High - blocks agent editing functionality

## Pending Issues

### ❌ TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors throughout the codebase
- **Areas Affected**:
  - Property access errors on various interfaces
  - Type mismatches in data sources
  - Missing properties in type definitions
- **Impact**: Build process fails, but runtime functionality may still work
- **Priority**: Medium - affects development workflow but not runtime

### ❌ Inconsistent Field Names in API Responses
- **Issue**: Some API responses use `modelName` instead of `model`
- **Status**: Handled with migration logic, but API should be standardized
- **Priority**: Low - workaround implemented

## Items to Monitor

- Agent data consistency after API updates
- UI reactivity to data changes
- Performance impact of enhanced logging
- Memory usage with force update mechanism
