## AI-Powered Contact Center Management System

### Overview
A scalable application for managing AI-driven customer service interactions with a hierarchical data model comprising messages → conversations → collections → groups, featuring advanced organization, filtering, and analytics capabilities.

### Core Data Structure

1. **Messages** (Atomic unit)
   - Content/text
   - Timestamp
   - Sender (user/AI agent)
   - Message type (text/attachment/system)
   - Read/unread status
   - Metadata (tags, priority)

2. **Conversations** (Message aggregation)
   - Unique identifier
   - User ID
   - AI Agent ID (identifying which AI system handled the conversation)
   - Conversation status (active/closed)
   - Conclusion state (successful/unsuccessful)
   - Start/end timestamp
   - Message thread
   - Tags/labels
   - Resolution notes

3. **Collections** (Conversation grouping)
   - Collection ID
   - Name/description
   - Filter criteria (AI-agent-based, time-based, outcome-based, or multi-factor)
   - Creation timestamp
   - Creator/owner
   - Access permissions
   - Metadata

4. **Groups** (Collection aggregation)
   - Group ID
   - Name/description
   - Purpose (AI performance evaluation/security/efficiency)
   - Collection IDs
   - Shared admin users
   - Permission levels
   - Analytics dashboards

### Key Features

#### 1. AI Conversation Management
- Real-time message handling with AI response generation
- AI agent workload management and transfer
- Multi-channel support (chat, email, etc.)
- AI-driven automatic/manual conclusion classification
- AI performance tracking and metrics

#### 2. Dynamic Collection System
- Flexible filter creation:
  - AI-agent-based: All conversations by AI Agent A
  - Time-based: Conversations from last week
  - Outcome-based: All successful AI resolutions
  - Multi-factor: Failed AI resolutions by Agent B in Q1
- Collection templates for common AI agent groupings
- Automated collection generation based on AI performance rules

#### 3. Group Management
- Hierarchical permission system
- Admin sharing and access control
- Bulk operations on grouped AI conversation data
- Data export and reporting tools
- AI analytics and insights generation

#### 4. Administrative Features
- User management (human supervisors, admins)
- AI agent configuration and monitoring
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for AI interactions
- AI performance metrics dashboard
- Data archiving and retention policies

### Operational Workflows

1. **Message Flow**: User → AI Agent conversation → Automated conclusion → Collection assignment → Group categorization

2. **Collection Creation**: 
   - Manual creation by admins for AI performance analysis
   - Automatic based on AI behavior patterns
   - Dynamic updates as new AI conversations match criteria

3. **Group Organization**:
   - Operational: Monthly AI performance reviews
   - Security: Sensitive AI conversation handling
   - Efficiency: AI agent optimization and improvement

4. **Data Access**:
   - Human supervisors: Monitor AI agent conversations
   - Admins: Group-level AI performance access
   - Executive: Aggregated AI analytics

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend
- Dashboard with three-column layout for AI conversation monitoring
- Real-time AI conversation updates
- Dynamic filtering and search across AI interactions
- Visualization components for AI performance analytics

#### Backend
- Message broker for real-time AI communication
- Database with optimized indexing for hierarchical AI conversation queries
- API layer for AI data access and manipulation
- Background workers for AI conversation collection management

#### Data Storage
- Relational database for structured AI conversation data
- Document storage for AI message content
- Cache layer for frequently accessed AI collections
- Archive storage for historical AI interaction data

### Use Cases

1. **AI Quality Assurance**: Review collections of conversations by new AI agent models
2. **AI Training**: Analyze groups of unsuccessful AI resolutions for system improvement
3. **Reporting**: Generate weekly summaries from time-based AI conversation collections
4. **Compliance**: Review security-flagged AI conversation groups
5. **AI Performance Analysis**: Compare AI agent effectiveness across different collection criteria

This system provides a flexible, scalable architecture for managing complex AI-driven customer service data while maintaining clear organizational hierarchies and efficient access patterns for AI conversation management.
